## Project 2: CUinSPACE Simulated Flight
This program combines all of the knowledge from this course after reading week. For context, this project is meant to simulate a rocket's data system that handles multiple events at once. For example, we look at the consumption and production of resources and find ways to prioritize events to ensure that everything runs smoothly. This system makes sure that no data is being wasted, ensuring maximum productivity and efficiency! 

  This project makes use of the following learing outcomes:
  1. (Chapter 4.1, 4.2) Write and use a Makefile to compile separate source files into object files and link them into a final executable?
  2. (Chapter 3.4) Allocate and deallocate collection structures using malloc, calloc, and free()?
  3. (Chapter 3.3, 3.4, 3.5) Work with and correctly free dynamic memory which is pointed to by multiple pointers?
  4. (Chapter 5.1, 5.4) Set up multiple threads with pthread and synchronize data shared between them using sem_t semaphores?

## Building and Running
  1. Open a terminal and navigate to the folder containing the program's files
  2. To use the Makefile, type `make run` and hit enter
  3. The program should automatically run
      3.a NOTE:  Typing `make` into the command line followed by `./a6` will also run the code
  4. Once the program starts, no user input is required. Everything is hardcoded in the main function.
